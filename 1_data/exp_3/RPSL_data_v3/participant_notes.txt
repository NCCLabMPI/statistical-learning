---------
- i0902	Incidental broken up into 2, 1-12 & 1-12. Evenly blocked, just uninterpretable for individual syllables.

- t0204	Incidental not blocked for the following participants (#1-3).

- b2308	Incidental no responses whatsoever. Another participant tested that day in the same booth has responses, so I don't think it was a technical error. Either she didn't understand the task or was pressing the wrong button.
