---------
1. Justify sample size based on the 3 papers - Done. 
- Power analysis based on Batterink's papers for Exp. 1. Nothing mentioned for Exp. 2

2. Outliers: need to justify a time window for acceptable responses - Done. 
I explained the method used. Batterink used a hard cutoff in two papers. 
- Batterink 2017: "Responses that did not occur within 0e1200 msec of a target were considered to be false alarms."
- B 2015: "Only responses that occurred between 150 and 1200 ms after target onset were included; all other responses were considered to be false alarms."
I looked and saw that indeed some responses are quite close to 0, but not many.
Accuracy on before vs. after outlier removal showed no change in overall accuracy.

3. Mean accuracy
- All lm's and ttests. - Done
All three variables vary in the 1st exp. The ones in the second exp vary depending on whether you use subject averages or the whole data set. Consider using the subject averages and then just explain away the effect in the first case. 
**- Report corrected values (either by regressing out, as can be done for word or syllable ID, or subsampling?) - To Do**
- Deal with accuracy confound in Exp. 2. 

3. Dissimilarity Analysis - Done. 
- Do z transformed z-dissimilarity | Kriegeskorte ref.
- H0: there is a difference
- LM: "If the sign is negative, there is a grouping, of information being used at these levels. There is a coding by which these things make a difference."

4. Rolling Average - Done
- Concat blocks. - Can't do that cause it doesn't make sense. 
- 1/2 the number of points so that it's smoother. - Done.
- Compare blocks 1 & 2. - See block analyses. 

5. Effect size - Done for each contrast.

6. SL measure. - Done. 
- T-test blocks 1 & 2. - There's no main effect, that's enough. 

7. Contrasts as polynomials. - No. 
- LM: put the data in two new regressions, polynomial vs. linear, to see which it is. - No, I don't see the point. 

8. Final Correlation - Done. 
- Take means from analysis, correlate with offline. 
(What to do about small sample size?)
To do this, we have to run this correlation analysis for each participant. But is the N large enough to do this? 

Corrections: 
1- Wilcoxons should be paired. I previously did them as unpaired. They are paired because the same data are contributing to the values in each array of the analysis. 
2- I will use corr or 1-corr. I will only use z(corr or 1-corr) if less than 10% of the data are lost due to the conversion to NA, and it does not affect the distribution (mean and sd) of each group. 
An issue: z-transformation of Pearson's r is not ideal for 1-r, since it cannot compute values outside the range (0,1). Therefore, all dissimilarity values (negative correlations become > 1 after the 1 minus operation) are actually thrown out (one has to remove NA values to obtain group means). This is why I would prefer to use the non z-transformed data. It does not result in a systematic bias in the results unlike the z-transformed. Otherwise, we can use the z-transformed correlation data. However, the z-transformation is not really necessary. The hypothesis test we use is non-parametric (Wilcoxon), which doesnt require a normally distributed sampling distribution (the whole point of doing the z-transformation). The values are still "comparable" between participants, however, because the correlation itself brings everything to within the same range.

###Honest Notes
1. Reporting age/sex
- Sex/age in Procedure 1 based off 38 participants in Morla, didn't check sex/age of other 3 participants.
35 German speakers. 
- That for Procedure 2 based off 18 participants in Morla, so ignores 2. 
14 German natives. 

2. Need to check the machine type and the Presentation version on the computers used in the Group testing room -- Experiment 2 Methods. 

3. I'm not sure if contr.sum was run before all analyses, which may mean that some of the values are based on contr.treatment...?

4. Read that for unbalanced designs, need to set contr.sum and also use type III anova for effects. 
http://www.utstat.toronto.edu/~brunner/workshops/mixed/NormalWithR.pdf

Again: older ref with anova types and contr. : http://md.psych.bio.uni-goettingen.de/mv/unit/lm_cat/lm_cat_unbal_ss_explained.html#:~:text=Summary%3A%20Usually%20the%20hypothesis%20of,follows%20the%20principle%20of%20marginality.

We set the contrasts appropriately in both. And I believe I can justify the choice of type II. But I did not check that all models actually registered the contrasts matrix setting.

5. If I don't report the full t/z test results, i dont report the d, since the analysis is derivative. 
- 1/acc/syll
- 2/acc/syll
- 1/block1-2/positions
6. Logic of TP correlation being 1vs0.33 needs to be defended...
