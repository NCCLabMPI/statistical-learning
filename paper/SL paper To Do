#SL Paper: To Do

## Writing
- Experiment 2 Discussion
- General Discussion
- Conclusion
- Abstract

## Analyses
- Add the word-wise correlation?
- Consider equivalence testing?
- Add statistics for the accuracy? 

## Read
- Turk-Brown Mutual Interference paper for discussion
- Paper Lucia mentioned
- For individual performance, return to Splitting the variance - Bogaerts

## Red Team
- Show it to Valeria, Valerie

Paper from Lucia
- visual SL
- exposure: 3 triplets
- test phase: sequence of three shapes, so basically a word; 20 items, 17 new

LM:
Justify sample size based on the 3 papers
- Power analysis
Outliers: need to justify a time window for acceptable responses
- Check if you have responses at 0.
 	- Batterink 2017: "Responses that did not occur within 0e1200 msec of a target were considered to be false alarms."
 	- B 2015: "Only responses that occurred between 150 and 1200 ms after target onset were included; all other responses were considered to be false alarms."
- Figure out if any are longer.- No.
- Do accuracy on pre-outlier data. 
		- Show no change? 

DONE for Exp 2., do for Exp. 1
- Do the mean t-tests
- If position varies: subsample; report also corrected values 

DONE
- Do z transformed z-dissimilarity | Kriegeskorte ref.
- H0: there is a difference
- LM: "If the sign is negative, there is a grouping, of information being used at these levels. There is a coding by which these things make a difference."


Rolling Average - 
9 points per block, concat them if it's not too much trouble

s value remove

effect size for each analysis

sl measure
add a lm comparing blocks 1 and 2 


summarize tables, put in SM

put the data in two new regressions; polynomial vs. linear

now that i have this information, which part of the information is entailed in the two tasks, correlate back with offline

Honest Notes
Sex/age in Procedure 1 based off 38 participants in Morla, didn't check sex/age of other 3 participants.
35 German speakers. 

That for Procedure 2 based off 18 participants in Morla, so ignores 2. 
14 German natives.
